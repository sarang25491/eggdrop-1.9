FUNCTIONS

int egg_dns_lookup(const char *host, int timeout, dns_callback_t callback, void *client_data)
int egg_dns_reverse(const char *ip, int timeout, dns_callback_t callback, void *client_data)
int egg_dns_cancel(int id, int issue_callback)
	This group of functions deals with DNS requests. Egg_dns_lookup
	provides a way to turn a hostname into a numeric IP (or IPv6) address.
	Egg_dns_reverse provides the opposite: a way to turn a numeric IP (or
	IPv6) address into a hostname. Both functions operate asynchronously;
	that is, they return immediately and wait for the DNS query to
	complete in the background. You must provide a callback function that
	will be called when the query either times out or is answered. If the
	answer is ready immediately (perhaps the data is cached), the callback
	will execute immediately as well (before the dns function returns).

	The callback function must be of the form:
		int yourcallback(void *client_data, const char *query, char
		**result);
	'client_data' is the same as the 'client_data' you passed to the
	dns function. You can use this parameter to keep track of whatever
	data you wish by passing a pointer to a structure containing all of
	the pertinent data.

	'query' is the original query you sent.

	'result' is a list of answers to that query. Each entry in the list is
	a null-terminated string, either a hostname or an ip address. The list
	itself is terminated by a NULL entry. If 'result' itself is NULL, that
	means no results were found, either because the request timed out or
	the request returned no information.

	Both functions return an id that can be used with egg_dns_cancel to
	cancel the request. When egg_dns_cancel is called, passing 1 to the
	'issue_callback' field will cause it to execute the callback (as if the
	request had timed out) before returning. Passing 0 will cause it to
	ignore the callback.

int egg_ident_lookup(const char *ip, int their_port, int our_port, int timeout, int (*callback)(), void *client_data)
int egg_ident_cancel(int id, int issue_callback)
	These two functions deal with ident lookups. Egg_ident_lookup begins a
	request asynchronously.

	'ip' is the ip address to probe.

	'their_port' is the port they are connecting FROM (on their computer).

	'our_port' is the port they are connecting TO (on the bot's computer).

	'timeout' is max time in seconds that you wish to wait for a response.
		You can specify 0 to use the default, or -1 to specify no
		timeout (wait forever).

	'callback' is the function that will be called when the response is
		received or the request times out. It must be defined as:

		int yourcallback(void *client_data, const char *ip, int
		their_port, const char *ident);

		'ident' will be NULL if there was an error.
	
	It returns an id that can be used with egg_ident_cancel to stop the
	request. Passing 1 to the 'issue_callback' field will cause it to
	execute the callback (as if the request had timed out) before returning.
	Passing 0 will cause it to ignore the callback.

int egg_iprintf(int idx, const char *format, ...)
	This function sends formatted text to an idx (sockbuf index). The
	syntax is the same as fprintf, except instead of a file pointer you
	provide the idx you want to send the data to.

	Returns: size of data sent (in bytes)

int egg_server(const char *vip, int port, int *real_port)
	This function creates a new idx that listens at ip address 'vip' on
	port 'port'. If the port is in use, it will try nearby ports. The port
	number that is actually used will be stored in the 'real_port'
	parameter (if it's not NULL).

	Returns: an idx representing the listening socket. You should set a
		handler for the idx to be notified when new connections are
		detected.
