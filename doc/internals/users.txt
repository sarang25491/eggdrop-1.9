STRUCTURES

user_t (typedef of struct user)
	This struct contains all the information eggdrop associates with a user.
	The most useful fields are char *handle and int uid. The other fields
	should be accessed through the provided libeggdrop functions. But in
	case you're curious, the char **ircmasks contains a list of irc masks
	for the user, and int nircmasks is the length of that list. Then,
	user_setting_t *settings is a list of flags and any other data stored
	in that user record.

	It is important to remember that users can be deleted at any time.
	Therefore, your code should not save pointers to these user records
	and access them later (after other code has executed). The record may
	have been freed, resulting in bad data or a crash. The best way to
	keep track of users in your code is to save the uid, which is unique
	and does not change even when the handle changes. Then use
	user_lookup_by_uid() to retrieve the user record. It is a fast operation
	since it uses an integer hash table.

FUNCTIONS

user_t *user_new(const char *handle)
	Create a new user with the given handle.

	Returns: a pointer to the user record, or NULL on error

int user_delete(user_t *u)
	Deletes a user record. Do not use the user record after it has been
	deleted.

	Returns: 0 on success

user_t *user_lookup_by_handle(const char *handle)
user_t *user_lookup_authed(const char *handle, const char *pass)
user_t *user_lookup_by_uid(int uid)
user_t *user_lookup_by_irchost_nocache(const char *irchost)
user_t *user_lookup_by_irchost(const char *irchost)
	This group of functions lets you look up a user record with the given
	information. User_lookup_authed is a convenience function to perform
	the lookup and check the supplied password in one step. If the password
	is not correct, the function will return NULL as if the user had not
	been found.

	An 'irchost' is irc information (nick and user) combined with a
	hostname, in the form nick!user@host. User_lookup_by_irchost and
	user_lookup_by_irchost_nocache differ only in that the first will cache
	the result of the lookup so that future lookups will be faster. However,
	if you know that your code will not be checking the same irchost soon,
	the nocache variant will save time and memory. The lookup will return
	the user that matches the given irchost most closely. For instance, if
	user A has the ircmask *!*@*.blah.com and user B has the ircmask
	*!*def@*.blah.com, then a lookup on somenick!abcdef@123.blah.com will
	return user B, since it matches more closely. In the event of a tie,
	the first user found will be the one returned.

	Returns: All of these functions return a pointer to a user record if
	it was found or NULL if it was not.

int user_add_ircmask(user_t *u, const char *ircmask)
int user_del_ircmask(user_t *u, const char *ircmask)
	These two functions manipulate the list of ircmasks for a user. An
	'ircmask' is a wildcard mask of irc information (nick and user)
	combined with a hostname, in the form nick!user@host. Wildcard
	characters are * (matches any chars) and ? (matches a single char). So,
	for instance, the mask aa*!*@*.aol.com would match
	aabbcc!zxcv@blah.aol.com or aa123!mmmm@123.aol.com... anybody with a
	nick that starts with aa and a hostname ending in .aol.com.

	Returns: 0 on success

int user_get_setting(user_t *u, const char *chan, const char *setting, char **valueptr)
int user_set_setting(user_t *u, const char *chan, const char *setting, const char *newvalue)
	These two functions manipulate the list of settings for a user. Each
	setting is associated with a channel, although it does not have to be
	an irc channel. For instance, a file-serving module might use the
	channel name "fserve" so that its setting names don't conflict with
	those of other modules and scripts. For access to global settings such
	as the password hash value and the password salt, pass NULL for the
	'chan' variable.

	When reading a setting, you pass a pointer to the variable that will
	hold the current value. For instance:

	char *value;
	user_get_setting(u, "fserve", "lastseen", &value);

	This code makes 'value' point to the current value of that setting. On
	the other hand, when you are setting a new value, you pass the value
	directly and not as a double pointer:

	char maxcps_str[128];
	sprintf(maxcps_str, "%d", transfer->cps);
	user_set_setting(u, "fserve", "maxcps", maxcps_str);

	Note that all settings are stored as strings, so if you want to store
	another data-type you must convert it to/from strings.
	
	Returns: 0 on success

int user_get_flags(user_t *u, const char *chan, flags_t *flags)
int user_set_flags(user_t *u, const char *chan, flags_t *flags)
int user_set_flag_str(user_t *u, const char *chan, const char *flags)
	These functions deal with user flags (a-z and A-Z). The flags are
	associated with a channel. Like channels for settings, these channels
	don't have to be real irc channels. For instance, a file-serving module
	may use the fake channel "fserve" to store permissions similar to
	the normal ones: a user with +n on "fserve" could be the fserve
	maintainer, etc. To access the user's global flags, pass NULL for
	the 'chan' variable.
	
	The user_set_flag_str function allows you to make relative flag changes
	in addition to fixed ones. For instance, the string "+o" would add
	the "o" flag without modifying the others, whereas the string "o" would
	set the user's flags to just "o" and nothing else.

	See also: flags.txt for information on flags_t

	Returns: 0 on success

int user_has_pass(user_t *u)
int user_check_pass(user_t *u, const char *pass)
int user_set_pass(user_t *u, const char *pass)
int user_rand_pass(char *buf, int bufsize)
	These functions deal with user passwords. User_rand_pass generates
	a random password from digits, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters.
	The result is null-terminated.

	Returns: user_has_pass returns 1 if the user has a password set, 0 if
	not. The others returns 0 on success.

int user_count()
	Returns: the number of users eggdrop has in its user database
