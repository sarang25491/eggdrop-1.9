PORTING TCL SCRIPTS TO EGGDROP 1.7

I. All Versions

No matter what version you are porting from, you will probably need to make
some of the following changes to your scripts.

1. Global Variables
Instead of listing every change here, I'll summarize by saying,

	***Dashes have become underscores in variable names***

For instance, 'botnet-nick' is now 'botnet_nick'. This was done to make
variables easier to deal with (no more ${botnet-nick}) and because some
scripting languages have a hard time dealing with embedded dashes.

2. Server Output
If you used:
	'putserv "blah" -next' - 'Putserv' now accepts '-next' as the *first*
		argument, not the second. It's still optional, of course.
		Old code: putserv "JOIN #chan mykey" -next
		New code: putserv -next "JOIN #chan mykey"

	'puthelp' - 'Puthelp' has been merged into 'putserv'. To access the
		help queue, simply add '-help' as the first argument.
		Old code: puthelp "NOTICE $nick :Hello there."
		New code: putserv -help "NOTICE $nick :Hello there."

	'putquick' - 'Putquick' has been merged into 'putserv'. To access the
		mode queue, simply add '-quick' as the first argument.
		Old code: putquick "NOTICE $nick :Hello there."
		New code: putserv -quick "NOTICE $nick :Hello there."

3. Binds
** under construction **

4. Timers
If you used:
	'timer' - The old 'timer' command let you set a timer for a given
		number of minutes. The new 'timer' command only deals with
		seconds and microseconds. All you have to do is multiply your
		timeout value by 60.
		Old code: timer 5 5minute_ad
		New code: timer 300 5minute_ad

	'utimer' - The old 'utimer' command let you set a timer for a given
		number of seconds. You will want to change this to the new
		'timer' command, which takes a 'seconds' parameter now instead
		of 'minutes'.
		Old code: utimer 30 trivia_question_timeout
		New code: timer 30 trivia_question_timeout

	'timers' - One popular method of determining whether a timer was already
		running in the older Eggdrops was to use this code construct:
			if {[string match "*my_proc_name*" [timers]]} {
				# it's running
			} else {
				# it's not running
			}
		That won't work in Eggdrop 1.7 because the 'timers' command
		only returns a list of numeric timer-ids, not the name of the
		procedure being called. It's easy to replace that construct
		with another.

		If you want to make sure your timer isn't run twice on .rehash
		then it's as simple as this:
			if {[info exists my_timer_id]} {
				killtimer $my_timer_id
			}
			set my_timer_id [timer 30 blah]
		The key to using the new interface is to *keep track* of your
		timer-ids. The timer-id is required to get information about
		a timer ('timer_info') and to stop a timer ('killtimer').

	'killutimer' - Just rename it 'killtimer' and you should be fine.
		'Killtimer' now works for all timers, including repeating
		timers. There is no more 'killutimer'.


	The script interface to timers has changed dramatically. 'Utimer' and
	'timer' have been combined and extended. The 'timers' command now
	returns a list of timer-ids without names. There is a new 'timer_info'
	command that returns a detailed list of information about a given
	timer.









II. Porting from Eggdrop 1.6

There have only been a few changes specific to the 1.6 series.

1. Binds
If you used:
	'bind evnt' - The new name of the 'evnt' bind table is 'event'.
		Old code: bind evnt - "init-server" blah
		New code: bind event - "init-server" blah









III. Porting from Eggdrop 1.3/1.4
** I don't have much experience with 1.3/1.4 scripting, so I'll leave this
mostly blank for now **

Porting from Eggdrop 1.3/1.4 to Eggdrop 1.7 is much like porting to Eggdrop 1.6.
The main things that changed (and that cause lots of errors in scripts) are
the arguments to the 'part' and 'notc' binds. Of course, all of the items listed
under "All Versions" also apply.

1. Binds
If you used:
	'bind part' - Callback procedures for the 'part' table now take an
		additional argument: the part message.
		Old code: proc part_handler {nick uhost hand chan} { ... }
		New code: proc part_handler {nick uhost hand chan msg} { ... }

	'bind notc' - Callback procedures for the 'notc' table now take an
		additional argument: the actual destination of the notice, since
		it could be a channel notice or a private notice.
		Old code: proc on_notc {nick uhost hand chan text} { ... }
		New code: proc on_notc {nick uhost hand chan text dest} { ... }
